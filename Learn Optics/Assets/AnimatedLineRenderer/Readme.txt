Animated Line Renderer for Unity

Created by Jeff Johnson

Animated Line Renderer is a very simple yet powerful way to animate the Unity Line Renderer. Easily add points to a line and specify how long it should take to get to the next point.

Two demo scenes are provided. One is a draw canvas, where you can drag the mouse and the animated line will follow the mouse cursor. The other is a simple asteroids demo with a phasor that shoots out and blows up asteroids.

The API is quite simple, and the best way to see it in action is to look at DemoScriptDraw.cs and DemoScriptPhasor.cs. I've also provided some prefabs for you to get started with.

Please let me know of any feedback at jjxtra@gmail.com.

Thank you!
