Optics Application for NJIT REU
Educational app designed to supplement a university-level physics curriculum. Graphically demonstrates and teaches ray-tracing concepts


The program teaches users the fundamentals of geometric [ray-tracing](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/raydiag.html).
It creates a sandbox environment that allows users to play with different types of optical elements (convex/concave lenses, mirrors, etc) so that they can learn about ray-tracing in a more responsive and interactive way.

The application's calculates the trajectory of the light rays using [ray transfer matrix analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_transfer_matrix_analysis).
